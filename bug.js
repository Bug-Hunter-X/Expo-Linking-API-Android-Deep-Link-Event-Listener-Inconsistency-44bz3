This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links on Android.  Specifically, when the app is already open and a deep link is tapped, the `Linking.addEventListener` doesn't trigger the callback. This results in the app failing to navigate to the correct screen or handle the deep link appropriately.  The problem is intermittent and difficult to reliably reproduce.
